# Web Scraping and Sentiment Analysis Project

This repository contains code and resources for a web scraping and sentiment analysis project. The project aims to scrape data from a list of URLs provided in an Excel file, perform sentiment analysis on the scraped text, and generate an output Excel file with the results.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **MasterDictionary:** This directory contains two text files: `negative-words.txt` and `positive-words.txt`. These files are used as reference dictionaries for sentiment analysis.

- **StopWords:** This directory contains seven text files, each containing various stop words. Stop words are commonly occurring words that are usually filtered out in natural language processing tasks.

- **Input.xlsx:** This Excel file serves as the input data for the web scraping process. It contains a list of URLs that need to be scraped.

- **Web_Scraping_and_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb:** This Jupyter Notebook file contains the code for web scraping and sentiment analysis. It is the main script that performs the tasks of scraping data from the provided URLs and analyzing the sentiment of the text.

- **output.xlsx:** This Excel file is the expected output of the project. It will contain the scraped data along with sentiment analysis results, organized in a specific format with predefined fields.
